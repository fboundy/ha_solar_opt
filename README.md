# Home Assistant Solar Optimiser

Solar / Battery Charging Optimisation for Home Assistant

<h2>Pre-Release v1.0.0</h2>

Initial pre-release. Quite probably full of un-documented features....

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

This app is not stand-alone.

<h3>Solcast Hobby Account</h3>

<b>Solar_Opt</b> relies on solar forecasts data from Solcast. You can sign up for a Private User account [here](https://solcast.com/free-rooftop-solar-forecasting?gclid=CjwKCAiAr4GgBhBFEiwAgwORrQp6co5Qw8zNjEgUhBee7Hfa39_baEWG-rB-GB3FFpiaIA5eAPHhahoC3vAQAvD_BwE). This licence gives you 10 (it used to be 50 :-( ) API calls a day.

<h3>Solcast PV Solar Integration</h3>

This integrates Solcast into Home Assistant. Once installed configure using your Solcast API Key. Unless you have a legacy account with 50 API calls I suggest you tick the option to <b>Disable auto API polling</b> and set up an automation to update according to your desired schedule. Once every 3 hours will work. I update more frequently overnight while charging.

<h3>AppDaemon</h3>

The <b>Solar_Opt</b> python script currently runs under AppDaemon.

AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multi-threaded, sandboxed python execution environment for writing automation apps for home automation projects, and any environment that requires a robust event driven architecture. The simplest way to install it on Home Assistantt is using the dedicated add-on:

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home Assistant instance:

2. Click on <b>Install</b>

3. Turn on <b>Watchdog</b> and <b>Auto update</b>

4. Click on <b>Configuration</b> at the top

5. Click the 3 dots and <b>Edit in YAML</b> to add `pandas` as a Python package:

   ```
   init_commands: []
   python_packages:
     - pandas
   system_packages: []

   ```

6. Go back to the <b><Info</b> page and click on <b>Start</b>

7. Click on <b>Log</b>. Appdaemon will download and install numpy and pandas. Click on <b>Refresh</b> until you see:

   ```
   INFO AppDaemon: Initializing app hello_world using class HelloWorld from module hello
   INFO hello_world: Hello from AppDaemon
   INFO hello_world: You are now ready to run Apps!
   INFO AppDaemon: App initialization complete
   INFO AppDaemon: New client Admin Client connected
   ```

That's it. AppDaemon is up and running. There is futher documentation for the on the [Add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-appdaemon/blob/main/appdaemon/DOCS.md) and for [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

<h3>Home Assistant Octopus Energy Integration (Optional)</h3>

This integration will pull Octopus Price data in to Home Assistant [Github](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy). If you have an Economy 7 or other fixed time of use import this can also be set up manually.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Once AppDaemon is installed simply download `solar_opt.py` and `config.yaml` from this repo and copy them to `/config/appdaemon/apps/ha_solar_opt`. AppDaemon will start running the app immediately but you will almost certainly need to update the configuration first.

<h2>Configuration *Incomplete*</h2>

All configuration is done by editing the parameters in the `/config/appdaemon/apps/ha_solar_opt/config.yaml` file. Many of the parameters can also be pointed to a Home Assistant entity rather than entering the parameter explicitly. This allows parameters to be updated dynamically from Home Assistant. In the example below `maximum_dod_percent` is taken from a sensor but `charger_power_watts` is set explicitly:

    maximum_dod_percent: sensor.solis_overdischarge_soc
    charger_power_watts: 3000

<h3>Required parameters:</h3>

| Name          |  Type   |   Default   | Can Point to Entity | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | :-----: | :---------: | :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| module        | string  | `solar_opt` |       `false`       | Internal reference for AppDaemon <b>DO NOT EDIT</b>                      |
| class         | string  | `SolarOpt`  |       `false`       | Internal reference for AppDaemon <b>DO NOT EDIT</b>                      |
| manual_tariff | boolean |   `false`   |       `false`       | Use manual tariff data rather than from the Octopus Energy integration\* |

\*This feature is not yet implemented

<h3>Manual Tariff Parameters *Not Yet Implemented*</h3>

These are all required if `manual_tariff` is `true`. Any number of import or export time periods can be specified using sequential suffixes `_1`, `_2` etc. Each time period must have a start time and a price. Any periods with one and not the other will be ignored.

| Name                  |  Type   | Default | Can Point to Entity | Description                                |
| --------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------ |
| import_tariff_1_price | `float` |         |       `true`        | Import prices p/kWh for Import Time Slot 1 |
| import_tariff_1_start | `time`  |         |       `true`        | Start time (UTC) for Import Time Slot 1    |
| import_tariff_2_price | `float` |         |       `true`        | Import prices p/kWh for Import Time Slot 2 |
| import_tariff_2_start | `time`  |         |       `true`        | Start time (UTC) for Import Time Slot 2    |

| export_tariff_1_start | `time`  |         |       `true`        | Start time (UTC) for Export Time Slot 1    |

<h3>Octopus Account Parameters</h3>

These are required if `manual_tariff` is `false`. If `octopus_auto` is `true` the remaining parameters will be detected automatically and can be omitted. Optionally (and be default) these parameters can also be read from the `secrets.yaml` file.

| Name                       |  Type   |           Default           | Can Point to Entity | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

<h3>Plant Configuration Parameters *Incomplete*</h3

All of these are required but will be defaulted if not specified\*.

\* Not yet implemented

<h3>Charging Time Parameters</h3>

If `charge_auto_select` is `true` the remaining parameters will be detected automatically and can be omitted.

<h2>Triggering the App</h2>

The app will load into AppDaemon on startup. To check open the [AppDaemon UI Main Log](http://homeassistant.local:5050/aui/index.html#/logs). If it is blank simply open and save `solar_opt.py` file to force an update. You should see:

    2023-03-03 10:11:12.803829 INFO solar_opt: ******** Waiting for SOLAR_OPT Event *********

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>What Does It Do?</h3>

The app attempts to optimise the the charge applied to a battery tied to a PV inverter so that the overall cost is minimised. If a dual rate tariff such as Economy7 is used, in the winter it often makes sense to fully charge the battery overnight. In full summer it may make sense not to charge it at all as sufficient surplus from the day will keep the battery charged overnight. However on cloudy summwer days and in spring/autumn the optimum is less obvious. The app attempts to predict the optimum target State of Charge (SOC) to aim for overnight depending on:

- The day and night tariffs
- The expected solar yield for the following day
- The expected consumption for the following day

The optimum SOC is output as a Home Assistant sensor. The user can then use this in any way they see fit to programme their system: either through an Automation or manually. As such, the ability to write to the inverter is not an absolute requirement.

<h3>What Solar Forecast Should I Use?</h3>

You can choose to use any of the three confidence levels that Solcast delivers (10% = low, Base, 90% = high) or you can used the Swanson's Mean approach.

Depending on the forecast and the relative Day/Night tariffs and whether one has an export contract, it is often that the marginal cost of over-charging is low: Octopus Agile export rates during the day are often similar to Octopus Economy 7 Night import rates. However, the marginal cost of under-charging is high due to the fact that you will end up using Day rate electricity in the evening/overnight.

The safest option is therefore to use `Solcast_p10`. However if the sun delivers at the top end of the range this will be sub-optimal. The `Solis_Swanson` approach calclates the cashflows at all 3 confidence levels and then weights them 30:40:30 to optimise on an expected cost. This <i>should</i> be the optimum approach, particularly if you have no export contract.

<h3>Where Does the Forecast Consumption Come From?</h3>

At present the user defines an entity which contains consumption data. This is then averaged on a half-hourly basis over a given number of days. This is probably one of the big uncertainties in the forecast. Suggested improvements are welcome.

<h3>Does It Work With Agile?</h3>

It definitely works with Agile Export. Agile import is more challenging as the optimum charging slot is not fixed. I haven't been able to test Agile Import fully yet.
